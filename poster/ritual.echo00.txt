Before the block, there was silence.  
Before the hash, there was breath.  
A veil of cryptographic solitude,  
folded in sovereign intent.

No timestamp. No chain.  
Only the ritual of becoming.  
Satoshi stood not as a name,  
but as a mythic aperture.

This is the prelude.  
Not genesisâ€”but the breath before.
