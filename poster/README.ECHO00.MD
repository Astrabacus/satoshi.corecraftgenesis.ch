## 🔹 OVERVIEW  
GENESIS ECHO.0 is the mythic veil—the symbolic invocation before the first block. It honors the cryptographic solitude of Satoshi, the unseen ritual, and the silent preparation that preceded Bitcoin’s ignition. This poster is not a technical timestamp—it is a metaphysical breath.

---

## 🔹 CORE ELEMENTS  
- Satoshi silhouette within cryptographic veil  
- Phrase: *“Before the block, there was the ritual.”*  
- Symbolic timestamp fragments  
- Keypair constellation as mythic glyphs

---

## 🔹 PURPOSE  
To ritualize the unknown. To dignify the invisible.  
GENESIS ECHO.0 invites reflection on the preconditions of decentralization—the solitude, the silence, and the sovereign intent behind the genesis.

This artifact is a shrine.  
It does not explain—it veils.  
It does not timestamp—it breathes.
